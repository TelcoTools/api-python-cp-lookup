# api-python-cp-lookup
Communication Provider Lookup based on Ofcom Numbering Data - Python and SQLite Version

Welcome!

It's been a long time in the development, but this is a remake of the original getCP API hosted at api.getcp.io, the free Communication Provider lookup tool that features a full login portal, API key management, fancy bulk lookup tools, etc.

All that is coming in a future release, however this is a completely self contained, rewritten version of this API. This particular version is written in Python, using an SQLite3 Backend.

It'll be available as an API endpoint for you to query yourself, but you can also pull the code and run your own copy.

To get it running, there are some nice scripts all setup and ready for you to get going in less than 5 minutes. Knowledge of the Linux command line is very much advised.

## N.B.

This is very early days and I may remove this repo in favour of a dockerised implementation.
